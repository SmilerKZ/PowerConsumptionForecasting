# PowerConsumptionForecasting

The main aim of the project is to build KN3B classifier [1] on a new dataset to forecast a peak power load on one day ahead. The novelty of this paper is the new dataset, which covers France country in the period between 2009 and 2011 years. The KN3B method is a combination of K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and Naïve Bayes classifiers. Even though this approach [1] seems simple, it demonstrates its superior performance over many other techniques starting from Naïve Bayes predictor alone to back propagation neural network [1]. The optimization of the classifier with outlier rejection, feature selection and model selection are neglected.

The report of the project is demonstrated in the "FinalReport.pdf" file.
